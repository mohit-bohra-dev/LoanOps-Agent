## ADR-001 â€” Orchestration: Microsoft Agent Framework

**Decision:** Use Microsoft Agent Framework as the primary orchestration framework.

**Context:** Need a Python-native orchestrator that integrates with Amazon Bedrock
and supports production-grade agents, tool use, workflows, telemetry, and AWS deployment.

**Alternatives:** Previous brief default, LangChain.

**Reasoning:** Microsoft Agent Framework is the successor path for Microsoft agent
development, combining agent abstractions, tool orchestration, workflows, telemetry,
and AWS integration while preserving a clean provider boundary in this repo.

**Status:** Accepted â€” this overrides the original orchestration default in
`docs/01-servicing-agent-prompts.md`.

## ADR-002 â€” Local LLM: Ollama + Llama 3.1 8B

**Decision:** Use Ollama for local dev; no AOAI credentials required to run
`make demo`.

**Reasoning:** Zero-cost local dev, same code path as AWS via `ChatProvider`
Protocol.

**Status:** Accepted.

---

## ADR-003 â€” Rep UI: Streamlit

**Decision:** Streamlit for the internal rep UI.

**Reasoning:** Fastest path to a working two-pane layout for an internal tool.
Next.js is noted as a stretch in App.5.

**Status:** Superseded by ADR-006.

---

## ADR-004 â€” Provider Abstraction Pattern

**Decision:** All 10 external capabilities exposed as `typing.Protocol`
interfaces; concrete implementations selected at runtime from env vars.

**Reasoning:** Required for local-first / AWS-target hybrid without code forks.
See `docs/01-servicing-agent-prompts.md` Â§A.6.1 for full rationale.

**Status:** Accepted â€” load-bearing, do not modify without a new ADR.

## ADR-005 â€” Unified Agent Rules: AGENTS.md

**Decision:** Consolidate all AI coding-agent instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`,
`GEMINI.md`, `context.md`, and IDE-specific rule files) into a single
canonical `AGENTS.md` at the project root.

**Context:** The project had 6+ separate rule files across `.cursor/rules/`,
`.agents/rules/`, `.kiro/steering/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`, all
containing overlapping subsets of the same constraints. This caused maintenance
drift and inconsistent enforcement across IDE contexts.

**Alternatives:** Keep per-IDE files in sync manually; use symlinks.

**Reasoning:** `AGENTS.md` is the 2025–2026 industry standard for cross-IDE
agent instructions, natively recognized by GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf,
Claude Code, Cline, and Gemini CLI. A single source of truth eliminates drift.
IDE-specific directories now contain thin pointers back to `AGENTS.md`.

**Status:** Accepted. Supersedes the `CLAUDE.md`-centric approach.

## ADR-006 â€” Rep UI: React with TypeScript

**Decision:** Migrate the internal rep UI from Streamlit to React with
TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS v4 for styling.
Deploy to AWS Static Web Apps instead of AWS App Runner.

**Context:** Streamlit (ADR-003) was chosen for rapid prototyping during
the POC phase. As the project matures toward pilot, the UI needs richer
interactivity (SSE streaming, real-time tool traces, drag-and-drop panels),
type safety, and alignment with enterprise frontend patterns.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Streamlit (status quo):** Limited interactivity, no component
  reusability, poor TypeScript story, vendor-specific deployment.
- **Next.js:** Server-side rendering and routing are unnecessary for a
  single-page internal tool behind auth — adds complexity without benefit.
- **Vue / Svelte:** Viable, but React has the largest ecosystem and most
  team familiarity.

**Reasoning:** React + TypeScript + Vite provides production-grade
interactivity, compile-time type safety, hot-module replacement, and
seamless integration with the existing FastAPI backend via Vite's proxy.
Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first `@theme`) eliminates config files and enables
a premium dark-mode design system.

**Status:** Accepted. Supersedes ADR-003.

## ADR-007 — Native Tool Calling

**Decision:** Migrate from JSON-based text tool parsing to native provider-level function calling (e.g., Ollama `tools`, OpenAI `tools`) across all `AbstractLLMProvider` implementations.

**Context:** The agent initially requested the LLM to output an `AgentTurnOutput` JSON object containing both the `answer` and `tool_calls` in a single generation pass. This caused two severe issues:
1. Smaller models (like Gemma 4) failed to reliably produce valid JSON with nested tool syntax, causing `AgentParseError`.
2. The agent was forced to "guess" the final answer before actually executing the tools, leading to hallucinations.

**Reasoning:** Native tool calling pushes the structured output constraint down to the provider API, eliminating parse errors. Splitting the agent loop into two passes (Pass 1: Tool generation -> Execute tools -> Pass 2: Final answer) allows the LLM to ground its draft reply in actual tool execution results.

**Status:** Accepted.
